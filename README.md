hey there, I'm Johep! 🦉
I really enjoy learning and trying new technologies or engineering topics,
currently, I'm learning OPP and how to apply it in the different languages I know 💻
I want to grow professionally and be part of a team whether it's an internship or full package! ☕️
By now my strong skills are in web development 🌐
And I'm constantly learning new languages and tools to be a full software engineer.
If you want to talk with me you can contact me on my LinkedIn as Johep Gradis or by any of my emails johepdg07@icloud.com or johep07@gmail.com 📨
